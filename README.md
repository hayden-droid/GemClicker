# Gem Clicker
Gem Clicker is an incremental/idle game in the same vein as Cookie Clicker. The gameplay is based on the idea of mining gems to earn money to mine more gems.

## Why?
I am making Gem Clicker as a learning exercise for HTMl, CSS and Javascript.

## Notes
Lots of features are yet to be added (achievements, stats, etc).
